# Student-Enrollment-Form
This enrollment page is made by using frontend technologies as Html, css for front-end design & JavaScript for functioning. All field of this form has proper validation & also display an error msg on failures which is done by using JavaScript language.
On submission, Enrolled students will be adding dynamically to the table.
The image will be loading from the url provided by the students in the form & on clicking website link will open in a new tab. The new enrollment form will be adding with a fade-in effect, which is done by CSS animations.
I have used Bootstrap framework for layout & forms  & to make webpage responsive for all resolutions and screen-sizes I have used media queries.
